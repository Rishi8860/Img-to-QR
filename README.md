# Image to QR Code Converter with Token Authentication

This project offers a solution for securely converting medical images, or any type of sensitive visual content, into QR codes. The QR code acts as a secure token that links to the original image. This system provides an additional layer of protection for confidential or private images, ensuring that only authorized individuals with the correct token can retrieve the original image.

## Key Features:
- **Image-to-QR Conversion**: Upload an image (e.g., a medical image) and generate a QR code representing it.
- **Secure Token Generation**: A unique token is generated for each image, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve the image.
- **Image Retrieval**: Future access to the image can be granted by scanning the QR code and using the token.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for protecting sensitive medical images, patient data, or any visual content that requires secure storage and retrieval.
- **Security**: The QR code and token act as secure links to the image, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring privacy.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Start Working:**:  
   Run the project to start converting images into QR codes:
   
   ```bash
   python app.py
4. **Access Your Image:**:  
   Run the project to start converting images into QR codes:
- After generating the QR code and token, scan the code using a QR code scanner.
- The QR code will retrieve the original image linked to the token.

## Future Use Cases:
- **Medical Image Protection**: Ensures that sensitive medical images are only accessible to authorized users.
- **Confidential Data Sharing**: Ideal for any business or organization that needs to protect visual data.
- **Secure Image Storage**: Protects images from unauthorized access while enabling easy future retrieval with the QR code and token.
